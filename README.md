# listmatch
open source program that matches the lists of numbers, strings etc

How to use it

Save the file (list‑compare.html).

Open it in any recent browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

Paste List 1 in the first textarea (you can copy‑paste the whole block you posted).

Paste List 2 in the second textarea (comma‑separated version works fine).

Click the “Compare Lists” button.

The page instantly shows:

✅ Matched values – present in both lists.

❌ Only in List 1 – values that exist in List 1 but not in List 2.

❌ Only in List 2 – values that exist in List 2 but not in List 1.

You can edit the inputs and press the button again as many times as you like – no page reload is required
